        <p class="section-header">Introduction</p>
        
        <p> Composite materials present unique challenges in structural engineering due to their anisotropic and, more specifically, orthotropic nature, which means their mechanical properties vary depending on the direction of the applied load. Unlike isotropic materials, which behave uniformly in all directions, composites require a more complex physics framework in order to accurately predict their behavior under different loading conditions. This directional dependence complicates the modelling process, especially when considering layered or laminated composite structures. To manage this complexity, engineers often rely on simplifications and idealizations that can capture the essential behavior of composites while remaining computationally feasible. One of the most widely used approaches for analyzing laminated composites is Classical Lamination Theory (CLT).
        </p>

        <p>
            The primary assumption of Classical Lamination Theory is that the structure in question can be approximated as a midsurface, meaning it has no significant thickness through its cross-section. Secondly, it breaks down the composite into a series of so-called 'laminae', which is just a Latin word for a thin, flat piece or plate. In practice, a lamina might be a ply of carbon fiber or a honeycomb sheet. Anything with uniform mechanical properties can be approximated as a lamina. By stacking these laminae together, we form what is known as a 'laminate'. These two assumptions form the basis of CLT and allow the complex underlying physics to be simplified into a series of straightforward matrix multiplications, which we’ll discuss next.
        </p>
        
        <p class="section-header">Behaviour of a Laminae</p>
        
        <p>
            Before we can dive into combining layers to create complex laminates, we first need to investigate the behavior of a single layer (or lamina). When discussing the mechanical properties of each layer, it’s done in terms of two primary directions. Assuming the reader has a basic understanding of composites, it’s generally known that a typical composite consists of two phases: the dispersed phase and the matrix phase. In the case of carbon composites, the dispersed phase is the carbon fibers, while the matrix phase is often a thermoset epoxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The carbon fibers typically have a very high elastic modulus, often in the hundreds of gigapascals, making them extremely stiff. In contrast, the matrix phase is much less stiff, often by two orders of magnitude. If you imagine a cured carbon composite, the direction along the fibers will inherently be very stiff, closely approximating the stiffness of the fibers themselves. On the other hand, pulling orthogonal to the fibers primarily engages the matrix, resulting in much lower stiffness. This explains why carbon fiber exhibits what's called an orthotropic nature: its mechanical properties vary depending on the direction of loading.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the purposes of Classical Lamination Theory, we’re concerned only with two in-plane directions. As a matter of convention, the fiber direction is labeled with the subscript ‘1’, and the matrix (or transverse) direction is labeled with the subscript ‘2’. So in practice, the elastic modulus of a composite along the fiber direction is referred to as E₁. This is important to keep in mind going forward, since different laminae will often be oriented in different directions, but each will have its own local coordinate system defined by these 1 and 2 principal axes.
        </p>
        
        <p class="section-header">Creating a Laminate</p>
        
        <p>
            In the process of creating a composite part it's common to 'lay-up' the structure by stacking layers one after another. Classical Lamination Theory works in much the same way, but mathematically. Before we get into the weeds of the matrices and linear algebra, its important to understand the reason behind these transformations. At the core of CLT, is the idea that each of the local laminae can be described only with it's local stiffness and it's orietnation with respect to the overall laminate. In this way, if we can create a mathematical construct of a laminae's stiffness, by performing coordinate transformations and then simple addition, the behaviour of many single laminaes can be combined into describing the behaviour of the entire laminate system.
        </p>
        
    
        <p class="section-header">Constitutive Equations</p>
        
        <p>
        The principal law governing the mechanical behavior of a material is the <strong>constitutive equation</strong>, which describes how a material deforms under applied stress. The term "constitutive" refers to a mathematical relationship between physical quantities (in this case: stress and strain).
</p>

<p>
  It's well known from elementary mechanics that <strong>Hooke's Law</strong> describes the deformation of a spring using a stiffness constant \( K \), as follows:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  F = Kx
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Since real-world materials behave like springs on a microscopic scale, we can extend Hooke’s Law to model them. In Classical Lamination Theory (CLT), the relationships between stress and strain must be expressed in matrix form to account for the directional dependence of composite laminae.
</p>

<p>
  The one-dimensional constitutive law becomes:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \sigma = E\varepsilon
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Extending this to the two-dimensional plane of a lamina (with in-plane directions 1 and 2), the stress-strain relationship in terms of compliance (the inverse of stiffness) is:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \varepsilon_1 \\
  \varepsilon_2 \\
  \gamma_{12}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{1}{E_{11}} & -\frac{\nu_{21}}{E_{22}} & 0 \\
  -\frac{\nu_{12}}{E_{11}} & \frac{1}{E_{22}} & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \frac{1}{G_{12}}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_1 \\
  \sigma_2 \\
  \tau_{12}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  To describe the stiffness instead of compliance, we invert the matrix and express the stresses in terms of strains. This leads to the definition of the <strong>Q-matrix</strong>, which represents the stiffness properties of a single lamina in its local coordinate system:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_1 \\
  \sigma_2 \\
  \tau_{12}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  Q_{11} & Q_{12} & 0 \\
  Q_{21} & Q_{22} & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & 2Q_{66}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \varepsilon_1 \\
  \varepsilon_2 \\
  \gamma_{12}/2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \quad \quad [\mathbf{Q}] = [\mathbf{S}]^{-1}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  This matrix describes the stiffness behavior of a single lamina in its own local reference frame. To understand how a full laminate behaves under load, we must transform each lamina’s local stiffness into the global (x-y) coordinate system of the full laminate. This requires a coordinate transformation.
</p>

<p>
  Since external loads are typically often given quantities in the global coordinate system, we need to rotate each lamina’s stiffness (and strain) from the local 1–2 system to the global x–y system. Once this transformation is performed for each layer, the global behavior of the laminate can be modeled by summing the contributions of all individual layers.
</p>

<p class="section-header">Stress and Strain Transformation</p>

<p>
  The following matrix is used to transform stress and strain components from the global coordinate system (x-y) to the local lamina system (1–2):
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_1 \\
  \sigma_2 \\
  \tau_{12}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  m^2 & n^2 & 2mn \\
  n^2 & m^2 & -2mn \\
  -mn & mn & m^2 - n^2
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_x \\
  \sigma_y \\
  \tau_{xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  [\mathbf{T}]
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_x \\
  \sigma_y \\
  \tau_{xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, the strain transformation from global to local coordinates is:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{Bmatrix}
  \varepsilon_1 \\
  \varepsilon_2 \\
  \gamma_{12}/2
  \end{Bmatrix}
  =
  [\mathbf{T}]
  \begin{Bmatrix}
  \varepsilon_x \\
  \varepsilon_y \\
  \gamma_{xy}/2
  \end{Bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  where:
  \[
  m = \cos \alpha, \quad n = \sin \alpha
  \]
  and \( \alpha \) is the angle between the local 1-axis of the lamina and the global x-axis of the laminate.
</p>
<p class="section-header">Transforming Q to Q̅ (Global Stiffness)</p>
<p>
    Now that we've established how to rotate a matrix, the procedure for constructing the global laminate stiffness matrix is rotating the \( \mathbf{Q} \) matrix into the so-called \( \mathbf{\bar{Q}} \) matrix. This refers to the local stiffness matrix of the laminae, but in the global coordinate system.
</p>
<p>
  To convert the local stiffness matrix \( \mathbf{Q} \) of a lamina into its global counterpart \( \mathbf{\bar{Q}} \), we apply a transformation based on the fiber orientation angle \( \theta \):
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \mathbf{\bar{Q}} = \mathbf{T}_{\sigma}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{T}_{\varepsilon}^{-1}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Where:
  \( m = \cos\theta \), \( n = \sin\theta \)
</p>

<p>
  The transformed stiffness matrix components are:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \bar{Q}_{11} &= Q_{11}m^4 + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})m^2n^2 + Q_{22}n^4 \\
  \bar{Q}_{12} &= (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 4Q_{66})m^2n^2 + Q_{12}(m^4 + n^4) \\
  \bar{Q}_{22} &= Q_{11}n^4 + 2(Q_{12} + 2Q_{66})m^2n^2 + Q_{22}m^4 \\
  \bar{Q}_{16} &= (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})m^3n - (Q_{22} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})mn^3 \\
  \bar{Q}_{26} &= (Q_{11} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})mn^3 - (Q_{22} - Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})m^3n \\
  \bar{Q}_{66} &= (Q_{11} + Q_{22} - 2Q_{12} - 2Q_{66})m^2n^2 + Q_{66}(m^4 + n^4)
  \end{aligned}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  The resulting global stiffness matrix \( \mathbf{\bar{Q}} \) is:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \mathbf{\bar{Q}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \bar{Q}_{11} & \bar{Q}_{12} & \bar{Q}_{16} \\
  \bar{Q}_{12} & \bar{Q}_{22} & \bar{Q}_{26} \\
  \bar{Q}_{16} & \bar{Q}_{26} & \bar{Q}_{66}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p class="section-header">Extension Stiffness Matrix</p>
<p>
  Assuming that all local laminae have had their stiffness matrices \( \mathbf{Q} \) transformed into their global counterparts \( \mathbf{\bar{Q}} \), the next step is to convert these thickness-independent stiffness matrices into <strong>lamina-specific extensional stiffness matrices</strong>, refered to as the \( \mathbf{A} \) matrix.
</p>

<p>
  This is done by multiplying each element of \( \mathbf{\bar{Q}} \) by the thickness of the respective lamina. This operation converts the units from <em>force per unit area</em> (e.g., N/m²) to <em>force per unit length</em> (e.g., N/m), which corresponds to the units of applied <strong>traction loads</strong>.  The expression for this transformation is as follows:
</p>
<p>
  The total extensional stiffness matrix for the laminate is obtained by summing the contributions of each ply:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \mathbf{A} = \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{\bar{Q}}^{(k)} (z_k - z_{k-1})
  $$
</p>

<p>
  where \( z_k \) and \( z_{k-1} \) are the distances from the laminate mid-plane to the top and bottom surfaces of the \( k \)-th lamina, respectively.
</p>


<p>
  Once the \( \mathbf{A} \) matrix is found, it's possible to relate in-plane tractions to midplane strains and ultimately predict the deformation of the laminate under applied loads.
</p>

<p class="section-header">Computing Laminate Strains</p>
<p>
  Finally, after all the matrix work, we're ready to get what we were after: the laminate strains. Some folks might choose to go one step further and convert these strains into actual deformations, but that’s just a matter of multiplying by the relevant length scale.
</p>

<p>
  To get the equation for the laminate strains, we first need to have our tractions sorted out. Now, you might be wondering, "What exactly is a traction?" Simply put, a traction is just a load applied per unit length. We work in terms of tractions because it lets us use the extensional stiffness matrix of what's called a "unit plate", basically, a square with side lengths of one. It simplifies the math and just takes a bit of extra setup up front.
</p>

<p>
  For example, think about a pressure vessel. The hoop traction is just the internal pressure multiplied by the inner radius. That gives you a force per unit length, or in this case, a force per unit wall thickness. Same goes for the axial (or longitudinal) traction, it’s also pressure times the inner radius, per unit thickness. Once you've got those tractions, we're only one step from getting our laminate strains. 
</p>

<p>
  With no bending moments involved, the laminate midplane strain vector is directly related to the applied in-plane tractions via the inverse of the extensional stiffness matrix:
</p>

<p>
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  \varepsilon_x \\
  \varepsilon_y \\
  \gamma_{xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  A_{11} & A_{12} & A_{16} \\
  A_{12} & A_{22} & A_{26} \\
  A_{16} & A_{26} & A_{66}
  \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
  \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
  N_x \\
  N_y \\
  N_{xy}
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
</p>

<p>
  Now that we have the overall laminate strains, our job is done! There are a few other operations you could perform, like transforming the global strains or stresses back into the local laminae coordinate system in order to calculate things like failure criteria. But those topics are outside the scope of this introduction. What we've covered here gives you the basic tools needed to carry out a simple Classical Lamination Theory (CLT) analysis.
